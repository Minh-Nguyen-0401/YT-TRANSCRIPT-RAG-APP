Jensen For the very first time in human history we are producing manufacturing intelligence like production Raw material comes in A lot of genius goes into that box And what comes out is intelligence thats refined Lukas Youre listening to Gradient Dissent a show about machine learning in the real world and Im your host Lukas Biewald Today on Gradient Dissent I interviewed a guest that Ive been looking forward to interviewing for quite a long time This is Jensen Huang who is the CEO and founder of NVIDIA If youve trained a machine learning model youve probably trained it on NVIDIA hardware We get into machine learning and we talk about his views on what the future holds This is a super fun interview and I really hope you enjoy it Lukas All right Well thanks so much for doing this We collected questions from our community they had a ton so theres more questions that Im sure we can get through So Im going to get into my questions first Jensen Okay Lukas I wanted to start with the number one question I wanted to ask you which Ive always wondered about Which is I think almost everyone training machine learning models these days uses NVIDIA and I was really curious about how conscious of a strategy that was Like when you started to think about it and how you made that happen Jensen It started when almost simultaneously three different research teams reached out to us asking us to help them accelerate their neural network models Turned out the reason for that was because they were all trying to submit for ImageNet the big competition And so deep learning came into our consciousness kind of around that time Lukas What year is this Jensen This iswhen was Alexs ImageNet Lukas It must have been like 2011 maybe Jensen Yeah I was going to say 2012 or 2013 But anyhow its something like that Anyways AlexNet it was that year It was kind of around our consciousness around that time The thing that was really exciting waswe all know that computer vision was hard to do And for Alex to have created a neural network trained it on a whole bunch of data and broken a record of computer vision experts of which many of them were at NVIDIA trying to do the same using human engineered features that giant breakthrough caught a lot of our attention Computer vision as you know is one of the foundations of artificial intelligence and all of a sudden a giant leap happened And when discontinuity happens on something that important it really caught our attention I think the difference between what happened around the rest of the world versus us is we took a step back and we said What is the implication of this Not just for computer vision but ultimately how software is done altogether Recognizing that for the very first time software is not going to be written features werent going to be engineered or created by humans but somehow automatically extracted out of data refined out of data to recognize patterns relationships and somehow learn the representation of some predictive model that observation early on caused us to ask the question How does this affect the future of software How does this affect the future of computer science How does this affect the future of computing How would you change the way a computerif the way that you write software is different then how does it change the way you would design computers And if the software thats written is written by a computer versus a human how does that affect the type of computers you would design We had the good sense of thinking about it from first principles the implications for the entire field of computer science and the entire field of industry Which ultimately led to asking the question What about the implications to all the different industries I think that the good fortune was we were interested in computer vision We saw the gigantic breakthrough from Alex and Geoff Hinton and the folks at Toronto and we simultaneously were working on it with several other labs at the same time So I think it was partly good fortune partly having the sense to realize the profound implications to computer science and then asking ourselves what the implication is for everything Lukas I think one of the things that youve done amazingly well is just stayed dominant in this space You mightve had a head start but of course lots of other people have noticed that this is a really valuable space And Ive been hearing since maybe 2014 companies saying Hey you know were going to make the next deep learning trainingGPU or TPU or something like that But youve actually really maintained this ubiquity in the market and I wonder what you attribute that to Is it more the architecture of the chip or is it more the software like CUDA and cuDNN Or is it something else that kind of keeps you ahead of the competition Jensen Well partly because the company was formed properly for this opportunity We were always in the field of accelerated computing If you could go all the way back to computer graphics all the way since the beginning of our company this new way of doing application acceleration domain-specific application acceleration of which computer graphics is one scientific computing and physics simulations and others is another image processing for example is another you could argue that deep learning is yet another these different domains of applications the company was started with that mission in mind Now in order to do accelerated computing domain-specific accelerated computing you really have to be a full-stack company You have to understand what is the application the nature of the application youre trying to accelerate You have to redesign the algorithm because the way that you would write an algorithm development algorithm for sequential processing is radically different than parallel processing Algorithm engineers our company has a richness of algorithm engineers You have to think about the system software and the systems differently because the workloads change the bottlenecks And so you have to think about system software differently you have to think about systems differently you have architecture of the chips differently Our company is fortunate that we are a full-stack company that goes all the way to the research of algorithms Thats what it really takes to be an accelerated computing company But I think the advantage that we have is that weve been a full-stack computing company for a very long time We have taken that skillset from computer graphics to imaging to scientific computing And then when deep learning came along it was a problem that our company was very adept at solving Lukas Thats a good segue into a question a lot of people had that I have also which is Is there a lot of tension between the needs of gamers and crypto miners and scientists and people in deep learning And how do you trade those off into a single chip Like how do you prioritize the different needs Or maybe theres no tension because everyone has to do the same type of workload Im curious how you think about that Jensen Yeah theres absolutely a tension For example scientific computingbecause it has a large body of historical code and they could be in FP64 whereas for consumer applications FP32 is just fine Whereas for deep learning its quite a large amount of different types of format that could be used The nature of the processing could be a little different Sometimes its very dense computation Sometimes its a little bit more sparse computation Ray-tracing for example is very sparse Rasterization on the other hand is rather dense Image processing is rather dense You have different computation natures You have different precision that you have to support Each one of the industries have a very large number of applications that are in use that you want to support and be able to accelerate And so each one of these industries are a little different We try to buildwe build a GPU that is universal in the sense that all of these applications can run on any of our GPUs And that gives developers a very large install base to target They know that when they develop on our architecture itll run it everywhere The only question is in each one of the processors that they run is it better for scientific computing or is it better for machine learning or is it better for imaging or computer graphics We shape the size of those capabilities those functionalities if you will for the different applications different markets that we serve In the case of GeForce there there is no FP64 richness although it runs It runs rather slowly In the case of deep learning chips itll run computer graphics but it will run less well than GeForce and so on so forth We adjust the size of the functionality to the market that we serve In combination with the software stack that goes on top of it we should be able to bring the best products for the use case Otherwise everything is universal and everything just kind of works Computer graphics scientific computing training inference We really believe that developers ought to have the largest possible install base and not worry about whether the softwares going to run or not It should all always run The question is whether it runs to its fullest capability Lukas I see Well another question along those lines is do you think radical changes are coming In particular do you think quantum computing is something really relevant to you Like something that will be a practical reality in the nextin our lifetimes or the next five to ten years Jensen It will definitely be in our lifetime because Lukas you and I are still pretty young So well definitely see it However its not likely to in the next five years to be generally useful On the other hand the important thing is and this is really the marvelous thing about machine learning and deep learning in many of the applications whether its drug discovery or large combination planning and optimizations pathfinding traveling salesperson problems these type of problems people have historically thought would need quantum computingbecause of machine learning because of AI weve made giant leaps Its not you know Moores Law-type leaps If you look at the body of work of your customers and our customers and the scientists that work in both of our companies in the last 10 years where Moores Law if it was moving at full rate would have increased performance by probably 100x many applications because of machine learning or deep learning its improved by 1000000x Lukas Totally Jensen Weve improved performance by a million times And over the next 10 years I fully expect that because of a couple of different innovations between accelerated computing and the further advances that were expecting in deep learning and this new field called physics-informed neural networks were doing some really fantastic work there in many areas in science scientific discovery were going to see probably another 1000000x 1000000x advance is something thats kind of hard to wrap your head around But were going to see that in so many different fields whether its in healthcare or climate science or other fields of physics that are really important to us Lukas Are you someone that believes that well see AGI in our lifetime Do you think the singularity is coming Jensen I dont know about that However if we reframe the problem if we reframe the question just slightly and say Will AI be able to do things that are much better than humans can You and I both know that in fact if you reframe the question that way AI in many many fields are already superhuman And I think that the number of superhuman skills that AI will learn over the course of the next decadeit is quite extraordinary I doubt that there will be many manipulation tasks that are repetitive that robotics wont do better than humans Which is one of the reasons why theres so much work in surgical robotics Their hands will never shake Theyll be able to make the most minute and the most precise of incisions and its perception ability is going to be incredible So I think that in the coming years were gonna see superhuman AIs They wont be like us but in many domains of activities theyd be quite incredible Lukas But I imagine where you sit youre watching AI help with chip manufacturing and design better chips And youre probably seeing that have compounding returns which I think is sort of the thesis behind the singularity right Its sort of AI starts to create AI You just see this exponential Jensen Thats exactly right Look were not going to be able to build next-generation chips without AI And thats kind of a remarkable statement That all of the chip design process the architectural processtoday we have 5 of the worlds top 500 supercomputers in our company and we are producing software that gets shipped with all of our AI chips Without AI we cant produce software that runs the AI And in the future without AI we wouldnt be able to design the chips that we use to run AI So thats right the circular positive feedback system is about to go into turbocharge I have every confidence that the next 10 years were going to see even greater advances Not necessarily at the transistor level but absolutely at the computation level Lukas Do you have any concerns aboutas compute gets more and more important to advances in science that theres impact on the climate or even impacts on access of whos able to make scientific discoveries or whos able to kind of make the next really exciting company if they need a supercomputer to do that Jensen First of all one of our greatest contributions to the industry is we democratized scientific computing Because of NVIDIA GPUs the breakthroughs for AlexNet wasnt a supercomputer in the cloud it was a GeForce card Simultaneously researchers around the world were buying GeForce GPUs And because architecturally theyre all the same as the supercomputers were building they were able to use that to discover the nextthe breakthrough that were all enjoying today The same thing is happening in so many different fields And so Im really proud of the fact that weve democratized high-performance computing We put it in the hands of any researcher They dont have to go get gigantic funds to be able to do their research One of the scientists that was in quantum chemistry said to me one day that he had learned from his son who was working at one of the computer companies here in Silicon Valley that he should go and buy our gaming cards and download the CUDA SDK and port the quantum chemistry software that he was running on an IBM supercomputer onto our gaming GPU He was so amazed how fast it was He had to wait for the rest of the week for the supercomputer to finish so that he could compare the results that it was the same And then he went and bought as many GPUs as he could from the retail stores and made himself a bespokea homemade supercomputer Lukas Thats awesome Jensen He said to me You know Jensen because of your work Im able to do my lifes work in my lifetime In a lot of ways we built him a time machine and he was able to see the future in a way that he otherwise couldnt So I think the first contribution is we democratized scientific computing The second thing that we didbecause of artificial intelligence and this idea of pre-trained models and transfer learning we now have the ability to essentially have large companies pre-train intelligence Its almost like creating a whole bunch of new college grads super well-educated college grads that are now going off into the world that people can then adapt to their particular skills In a lot of ways Lukas the work that you do the work that I do what weve done is weve actually lowered the bar Weve democratized intelligence We democratized computer science so that almost anybody can download a pre-trained model and perform superhuman capabilities for their application domain by retraining it by adapting it by applying a transfer of learning capability to it I think artificial intelligence is the most powerful force that has come along And one of its benefits is going to be to democratize computer science Now one of the things that you mentioned earlier about energyI think that one of the greatest projects were working on is this thing called Earth-2 which is a digital tool whichwere going to try to build a digital twin to mimic the climate of the earth Its a multi-physics problem thermal dynamics and fluid dynamics and chemistry problem and a biology problem and the human driver problem and economic problem All of it contributes in this geometry-awarebecause you know terrain matters and multi-physicsand we finally might have the necessary algorithms to be able to take a swing at this and build a full-scale digital twin of the earth And hopefully inspire us by giving us a model to test our mitigation strategies and our adaptation strategies and simulate whether the technologies were going to use to absorb carbon or carbon emissions will have the necessary impact a decade two decades four decades from now If not for deep learning and the work that were doing that wouldnt even be possible I wouldnt even imagine doing it Lukas Cool One of the things I wanted to make sure I asked you on a personal level is Ive really admired how youve run the same company for a really long time It doesnt look like an easy company to run I mean theres a lot going on and a lot of physical things and it clearly hasnt just been this rocket-ship SaaS startup And yet you seem very technically current It really does seem like you stay on top of trends and keep a level of technical depth I was wondering how you do that how you stay educated about whats going on in scientific computing and machine learning and other topics Jensen Well Im a little sleepy right now because I was up at three oclock reading andtheres just no other way I think you just have to keep on learning Lukas Youre just interested in the topic and you just- Jensen -I dont know I dont know that theresI wish Lukas there was wisdom to pass I paused for a second Was there a secret Nope I think partly of course is really Wheres the energy and the curiosity juice coming from Being surrounded by really bright people you learn from them which allows you to combine a lot of your own understanding And when you decode a puzzle or you learn something new it really gets you fired up I think one of the most important missions and the purpose of a CEO is to create the conditions where amazing people could do their lifes work I really take that very seriously I try very hard to create a condition where amazing people could come and be surrounded by other colleagues that are incredible That I think contributes a lot to it And then the rest of itas a CEO of a tech company you really need to enjoy learning about whats happening in your company which has plenty to learn and whats happening around the industry and see if you could imagine a future thats better for everybody Lukas I think a big part of my learning process thats hard to do running a company is tinkering and stuff Im wondering if thatsI think youre originally an engineer Do you find time to ever write a little code or put something together Jensen Not for a long time But we get to tinker through other people This is the wonderful thing NVIDIA is now 24000 people If I could tinker a little something with everybody the amount of tinkering thats going around the company is incredible Theres a phrase that I say I reach out to my friends and I really see them that way I reach out to my friends all over the company and we brainstorm a little something and they go off and try something and somebody else theyre brainstorming with they try something Thats I guess tinkering at scale Lukas Thats super cool I love it Another question a lot of people askIm curious people originally think of NVIDIA as for games Are you a gamer at all Do you play video games Jensen I havent played much games I see almost every game that goes by because we get the benefit of some collaboration that we do with just about every game company in the world So when theyre in the labs people will tell me and Ill run down and go check it out and play with it a bit But the last time probablyone of my favorite games was when Battlefield first came out My kids were teenagers at home and they were both coming into their gaming age And the three of us playing online Battlefield was just incredibly fun That was probably some of the funnest memories Ive ever had Lukas Thats awesome Im curious A lot of people have been talking about you know supply chain issues and a global chip shortage Is that something thats on your mind a lot Is that a problem for your company Jensen Sure Yeah sure We build the largest chips in the world and the most complex computers in the world DGX is a few hundred pounds Its so heavy Its the heaviest computer thats being built today It is so heavy that it takes a robot to build it like a car Most computers dont have to be built that way but DGX is a miracle of computing And we built it completely from a blank sheet of paper wrote all the software and all the tools that went on top of it Theres a lot of components inside especiallysomething thats a few thousand watts is quite a miracle There are a lot of parts and all it takes is one diode or one voltage regulator to keep it from shipping So our NVIDIA supply chain is quite an amazing machine We know that artificial intelligence is such an amazing thing because we are producing intelligence For the very first time in human history we are producing manufacturing intelligence like production Raw material comes in A lot of genius goes into that box And what comes out is intelligence thats refined And so large companies are depending on us AI is intelligence being manufactured at large scales So the teams are working really really hard to keep up with demand Lukas Youve been running NVIDIA for quite a long time I was curious how you feel youve changed as a leader over the decades of running the company Jensen You know youre almost asking the wrong person You could ask almost anybody else around me Lukas Fair enough How has your experience changed Jensen Thats an easier question for me When I was 30 years old I didnt know anything about being CEO I did a lot of learning on the job There were many management techniques that were just really dumb and I dont use them anymore Lukas Like what Jensen Well alright Ill give you a couple Lukas Awesome Thank you Jensen The list of dumb things that Ive done over the years is quite large I could write a book But for example I really wanted in the early days for the chips to tape out I thought what we needed to do was motivate the engineers to tape out the chip So we had this thing called a tapeout bonus And thats just a supremely dumb idea The reason for that is because if the engineers could have taped out the chip they would have Putting that bonus there is unnecessary On the other hand by definition theyre gonna be late And when theyre late it becomes a de-motivator because they no longer can earn a bonus The tapeout bonus for all the CEOs that are doing it its a de-motivator not a motivator Its a little silly I think the answer is a chip gets taped out when a chip is ready to be taped out We can create the conditions by which great work can be done We can be good listeners and eliminate obstacles for the team We could be part of the solution by highlighting issues recruiting All kinds of things that we can do to help them reason about priorities help them reduce the scope of their work and try to seek the minimum viable product instead of building such giant things There are a lot of different skills that we couldve instilled into the organization but the one thing that it doesnt really need is a tapeout bonus an achievement bonus Because everybodys trying to do their best Thats one example Lukas Thats a great one What else If youve got others Id love to hear them Jensen Okay Heres another one Well I want to be diplomatic as well because theres so many CEOs that are out there They could be using some of these techniques and I hate to be critical of them So this is not a criticism this is just my style I tend not to do one-on-ones If theres anything that I need to say I tend to like to say it to the team and the group that is working on it so that were all hearing the same things Im hearing the same things everybody else is hearing the same things instead of being translated Lukas Interesting Thats a really unusual perspective I think a lot of people think you absolutely must do one-on-ones So you do that across the company Do you think like your reports- Jensen -I dont do it I dont do it but I have many leaders who do I dont criticize them for doing it I just dont do it The reason that its probably more important for CEOs not to is becauseyou cant eliminate it completely but you want to reduce the amount of Jensen told me or Jensen told me that as a way to somehow steer a conversation that otherwise should have been done on merits And instead of my will somehow being translated and repeated and interpreted through a chain If I had a particular objection towards something I would say it to more than one person If I believe that in working with the rest of the company a particular strategy or direction ought to be taken I would tell everybody at the same time Ive worked towards this approach because I feel its much more transparent It puts knowledge and the access to information in the hands of as many people as possible And of course it attracts more criticism to myself For example I might say something to ten people and it is the dumbest thing in the world to say It was a terrible idea you know couldnt be a worse possible strategy But instead of saying it to one person I dont get the benefit of refining my ideas and then broadcasting it and always being a genius Therefore in this technique you need to be a little bit more vulnerable and you need to be able to deal with the fact that every so often you said something that wasnt perfect Nobody holds me to a standard that needs to be perfect anyhow And so I after nearly 30 years Ive kind of worked my way past that If I say something dumb dont hold me to it Give me a chance to change my mind Lukas Is it a different experience running a company where it feels like its struggling versus now where the stock seems really high and probably everyones feeling really good about the prospects Do you have to do different things in those different situations Jensen Im never different I dont think its possible to find a correlation between my behavior and the stock price And I would say for 29 years my behavior and the way that I approach problems the way I approach people the way I approach a company or workexactly the same Theres no correlation whatsoever You just got to give me a second Ill find all kinds of issues to talk about Ive got nothing but problems thatyou know CEOs are surrounded by problems not good news I happen to enjoy that I enjoy solving problems So I completely separate the financial success of the company from the importance of the work and doing impactful work Ive historically always done that whether the company is doing well or badly When we were doing badly particularly during the time when we bet the farm on accelerated computing we wanted every single chip to have the same architecture that I mentioned earlier the pressure on our financial performance was immense But I was equally as enthusiastic then and believed as much in the future as I do today Lukas Thats incredible You dont feel the outside pressure at all or are you able to separate yourself from it Jensen No as a public company youre going to feel a lot of outside pressure Some investors are really artful in expressing their displeasure and criticism and some investors are understandably less patient But its our job to express the reason why were doing what were doing CEOs have to bewe have to be reasoned We have to have a purpose by which were doing something If were clear in expressing why were doing something and our vision for it and we genuinely believe it we genuinely believe it my experience has been that people are willing to give it a shot When we first started our company consumer 3D graphics didnt exist Even APIs for it didnt exist We had to go evangelize that And it took longer than people thought When we moved into accelerated computing for about 15 years it didnt exist It took longer than I thought I thought it was going to take 2 years but it took 15 AI was the same way I spoke endlessly about the importance of machine learning and deep learning for the first 5 6 7 years I think people just didnt get it Which is fine Thats part of building a new market and building a new approach You have to recognize that it takes time for people to come along I think the industry has been really patient with us and our employees have been very patient with me Ive really appreciated it Lukas Whats the thing that really motivates you right now Whats the purpose that you feel like youre serving at this moment Jensen Our missionthe company doesnt have a mission statement but nobodys confused at our company in what the mission is It really is as simple as Do impactful work that takes a very long time to succeed because it has to be hard for it to be meaningful for our people and that we are the best in the world at solving We seek those problems I seek those problems There are two areas that Im super excited about right now One area is recognizing that we in several domains have invented the intelligence capability the technology of intelligence Whether its in perception or speech AI or language understanding were now able to have some technologies that can do these things However ultimately whats valuable is not intelligence Ultimately whats valuable is skills We hire new college grads with lots of intelligence but very few skills And then we give them skills by adapting them to domains In a lot of ways thats essentiallywhat is missing right now is to take the intelligence technology and translate it into valuable skills Valuable skills whether its driving autonomous vehicles Valuable skills like customer service and call centers and such Valuable skills like automated checkout It could be automated skills like radiology Put a radiologist right into the instrument There are all kinds of really valuable skills that we can now create Thats a big part of where our energy is right now how to take this enabling technology and translate them into skills that customers in the industry developers could then adapt it for all kinds of different domains Thats one the large-scale application of artificial intelligence Second is the next era of AI Weve done a really good job with soft AI thats in the cloud Recommending music recommending movies and the next item in the cart and so on and so forth Its really incredible The thing that we would really like to do is toif we want to take AI into the point of where people are and into this next phase of its journey AI has to learn the laws of physics Many of the worlds challenges whether its climate science or autonomous vehicles or manufacturing or whatever it is the AI cant just make a prediction It has to make a prediction that obeys the laws of physics conservation of matter conservation of energy and such It has to understand the concept of synchronous time It has to be working within our time There are a lot of these types of problems that are really impossible to develop that AI unless we have something that is essentially a virtual world that obeys the laws of physics Which is the reason why we built Omniverse We built Omniverse so that several things could happen Its physically based Its distributed Its very large It has the ability to support very large models And the goal is several fold One you could teach a robot how to be a well-functioning robot in this physically based environment You could connect it to IOT systems for example running a robot hardware in the loop It has the ability to be connected to the physical world and stay synchronized meaning to build a digital twin The concept of a digital twin has been around for some time but in combination with artificial intelligence the digital twin is going to have a profound impact on the future So Im super excited about these areas One is just the application and then the others the next phase of AI Thats what Omniverse is all about Lukas Yeah I totally agree that things like Omniverse is really critical for making robotics work It sounds like youre interested in getting your company closer to the applications of AI is that right Jensen Well stay a couple of clicks away from the actual application But what we would do is we would create an application framework for people who are building applications to build applications One of the application frameworks that Im really excited about created a little demo They called it toy Jensen at the last GTC keynote Basically its a robot But its a virtual robot otherwise known as an avatar It has computer vision it has speech AI and understands language So on and so forth Im super excited about that because in the future many applicationswe really need to go into the application to experience it whether its a virtual factory or virtual hospital or what not It could be for entertainment like the metaverse and the next era of the internet You want to go into that world And the way to go into that world is through a wormhole called VR We can go into that world But we could also have those agents come out of that world and collaborate with us They would come out through the wormhole called AR and be in our world But otherwise the metaverse is enjoyed using my favorite display which is a computer display People think that you need to wear head-mounted displays for the metaverse but its furthest from the truth The metaverse will be enjoyed largely on 2D displays Lukas Interesting Well we always end with two questions that I want to make sure that I get them in The second-last question and youve touched on some of these topics but Im curious when you look at machine learning do you feel like theres a question thats underexplored Like you would recommend to a grad student to look into or if you had more time youd like to spend some more time investigating Jensen Well some of the research work thats being done right now theres so many smart people working on it because its really important the self-supervised learning approaches that are multi-modalityLukas thats going to drive the living daylights out of the platform youre building and the platforms were building Multimodality AI where you have vision and the vision doesnt have to just be images It could be video speech and natural language thats going to take perception to a brand new level Im super excited about that Im excited about zero-shot learning To be able to learn from whatever youre trained on plus the priors that you have is really quite exciting and powerful I think that one of the areas that is being explored now is to project the framework of graphs into the framework of deep learning Or graph neural networks Graph neural networksgraphs the relationship of things is basically a structure that can describe almost everything meaningful in life Thats why its so useful Lukas Totally Jensen But the processing of graphs is cumbersome The breakthroughs with DGL and GNN and geometric and all of that to project the graph into the framework the constructs of a deep learning pipeline puts it into our world where deep learning has been so effective Im excited about that and I hope that a lot more people do that work Lastly I think there will be more innovation and more design and more creativity thats going to be done in the virtual world than all of the creativity and design that has ever been done in the physical world What people call the metaverse is going to be just brand new ground for manufacturing for design for artists for entertainment of all kinds Im super excited about that I mean theres so many things to work on Lukas Awesome That was a great answer Our final question in the last few minutes we havetheres this trope that machine learning especially deep learning projects almost never see the light of day That theyre way harder to manage than traditional engineering Im curious When you look across your customer base what are the most common issues that prevent machine learning from really solving the problems that customers actually have Jensen Yeah this is really great Its a great question and its also one of the things I love the most about your company and the way you think about this Theres a fundamental difference between the technology of deep learning and the harnessing of deep learning and machine learning to write software The importance of the methods and the process and the tools that is so vital What could be described as MLOps so vital You have to understand not just the neural network architecture and to be able to invent something that produces excellent results is of course groundbreaking work there already by itself but a company in order to take advantage of this has to realize that in the final analysis this is an intelligence factory You have to think of it like a factory Thats the reason why the word ops makes sense Its a factory You have the raw material coming in which is the data It gets transformed in the middle through a lot of stages of very complicated transformation Which is one of the reasons why your tools are so popular Its really complicated stuff To manage that workflow in a productive way and transform that raw material into ultimately an output that is a neural network or otherwise intelligence-at-scale is quite a significant process Its a fundamentally new way of thinking about computer science We used to have just engineers do it I dont mean just in that way but we had engineers do it But now we have engineers backed up by giant supercomputers that are operating these incredible operations software stack that you build The refining process the continuous refining process the validation process the simulation processthat entire process had to be reinvented for machine learning reinvented for deep learning This is the reason why your work is so important You guys are doing a great job I really appreciate the work that you do and all the researchers that you support and all the workflows that you are making possible This is what every company needs to understand That software development in the future is a bit of a refinery process Its a refinement process Its an MLOps process Its you know manufacturing Lukas Well thanks so much Thats really kind of you and Im touched I appreciate it Jensen Keep up the great work Lukas If youre enjoying these interviews and you want

really hard to produce So check it out

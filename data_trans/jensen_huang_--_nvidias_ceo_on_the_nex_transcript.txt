jensen first time human history producing manufacturing intelligence like production raw material comes lot genius goes box comes intelligence thats refined lukas youre listening gradient dissent show machine learning real world im host lukas biewald today gradient dissent interviewed guest ive looking forward interviewing quite long time jensen huang ceo founder nvidia youve trained machine learning model youve probably trained nvidia hardware get machine learning talk views future holds super fun interview really hope enjoy lukas right well thanks much collected questions community ton theres questions im sure get im going get questions first jensen okay lukas wanted start number one question wanted ask ive always wondered think almost everyone training machine learning models days uses nvidia really curious conscious strategy like started think made happen jensen started almost simultaneously three different research teams reached us asking us help accelerate neural network models turned reason trying submit imagenet big competition deep learning came consciousness kind around time lukas year jensen iswhen alexs imagenet lukas must like 2011 maybe jensen yeah going say 2012 2013 anyhow something like anyways alexnet year kind around consciousness around time thing really exciting waswe know computer vision hard alex created neural network trained whole bunch data broken record computer vision experts many nvidia trying using human engineered features giant breakthrough caught lot attention computer vision know one foundations artificial intelligence sudden giant leap happened discontinuity happens something important really caught attention think difference happened around rest world versus us took step back said implication computer vision ultimately software done altogether recognizing first time software going written features werent going engineered created humans somehow automatically extracted data refined data recognize patterns relationships somehow learn representation predictive model observation early caused us ask question affect future software affect future computer science affect future computing would change way computerif way write software different change way would design computers software thats written written computer versus human affect type computers would design good sense thinking first principles implications entire field computer science entire field industry ultimately led asking question implications different industries think good fortune interested computer vision saw gigantic breakthrough alex geoff hinton folks toronto simultaneously working several labs time think partly good fortune partly sense realize profound implications computer science asking implication everything lukas think one things youve done amazingly well stayed dominant space mightve head start course lots people noticed really valuable space ive hearing since maybe 2014 companies saying hey know going make next deep learning traininggpu tpu something like youve actually really maintained ubiquity market wonder attribute architecture chip software like cuda cudnn something else kind keeps ahead competition jensen well partly company formed properly opportunity always field accelerated computing could go way back computer graphics way since beginning company new way application acceleration domain specific application acceleration computer graphics one scientific computing physics simulations others another image processing example another could argue deep learning yet another different domains applications company started mission mind order accelerated computing domain specific accelerated computing really full stack company understand application nature application youre trying accelerate redesign algorithm way would write algorithm development algorithm sequential processing radically different parallel processing algorithm engineers company richness algorithm engineers think system software systems differently workloads change bottlenecks think system software differently think systems differently architecture chips differently company fortunate full stack company goes way research algorithms thats really takes accelerated computing company think advantage weve full stack computing company long time taken skillset computer graphics imaging scientific computing deep learning came along problem company adept solving lukas thats good segue question lot people also lot tension needs gamers crypto miners scientists people deep learning trade single chip like prioritize different needs maybe theres tension everyone type workload im curious think jensen yeah theres absolutely tension example scientific computingbecause large body historical code could fp64 whereas consumer applications fp32 fine whereas deep learning quite large amount different types format could used nature processing could little different sometimes dense computation sometimes little bit sparse computation ray tracing example sparse rasterization hand rather dense image processing rather dense different computation natures different precision support one industries large number applications use want support able accelerate one industries little different try buildwe build gpu universal sense applications run gpus gives developers large install base target know develop architecture itll run everywhere question one processors run better scientific computing better machine learning better imaging computer graphics shape size capabilities functionalities different applications different markets serve case geforce fp64 richness although runs runs rather slowly case deep learning chips itll run computer graphics run less well geforce forth adjust size functionality market serve combination software stack goes top able bring best products use case otherwise everything universal everything kind works computer graphics scientific computing training inference really believe developers ought largest possible install base worry whether softwares going run always run question whether runs fullest capability lukas see well another question along lines think radical changes coming particular think quantum computing something really relevant like something practical reality nextin lifetimes next five ten years jensen definitely lifetime lukas still pretty young well definitely see however likely next five years generally useful hand important thing really marvelous thing machine learning deep learning many applications whether drug discovery large combination planning optimizations pathfinding traveling salesperson problems type problems people historically thought would need quantum computingbecause machine learning ai weve made giant leaps know moores law type leaps look body work customers customers scientists work companies last 10 years moores law moving full rate would increased performance probably 100x many applications machine learning deep learning improved 1000000x lukas totally jensen weve improved performance million times next 10 years fully expect couple different innovations accelerated computing advances expecting deep learning new field called physics informed neural networks really fantastic work many areas science scientific discovery going see probably another 1000000x 1000000x advance something thats kind hard wrap head around going see many different fields whether healthcare climate science fields physics really important us lukas someone believes well see agi lifetime think singularity coming jensen dont know however reframe problem reframe question slightly say ai able things much better humans know fact reframe question way ai many many fields already superhuman think number superhuman skills ai learn course next decadeit quite extraordinary doubt many manipulation tasks repetitive robotics wont better humans one reasons theres much work surgical robotics hands never shake theyll able make minute precise incisions perception ability going incredible think coming years gon na see superhuman ais wont like us many domains activities theyd quite incredible lukas imagine sit youre watching ai help chip manufacturing design better chips youre probably seeing compounding returns think sort thesis behind singularity right sort ai starts create ai see exponential jensen thats exactly right look going able build next generation chips without ai thats kind remarkable statement chip design process architectural processtoday 5 worlds top 500 supercomputers company producing software gets shipped ai chips without ai cant produce software runs ai future without ai wouldnt able design chips use run ai thats right circular positive feedback system go turbocharge every confidence next 10 years going see even greater advances necessarily transistor level absolutely computation level lukas concerns aboutas compute gets important advances science theres impact climate even impacts access whos able make scientific discoveries whos able kind make next really exciting company need supercomputer jensen first one greatest contributions industry democratized scientific computing nvidia gpus breakthroughs alexnet wasnt supercomputer cloud geforce card simultaneously researchers around world buying geforce gpus architecturally theyre supercomputers building able use discover nextthe breakthrough enjoying today thing happening many different fields im really proud fact weve democratized high performance computing put hands researcher dont go get gigantic funds able research one scientists quantum chemistry said one day learned son working one computer companies silicon valley go buy gaming cards download cuda sdk port quantum chemistry software running ibm supercomputer onto gaming gpu amazed fast wait rest week supercomputer finish could compare results went bought many gpus could retail stores made bespokea homemade supercomputer lukas thats awesome jensen said know jensen work im able lifes work lifetime lot ways built time machine able see future way otherwise couldnt think first contribution democratized scientific computing second thing didbecause artificial intelligence idea pre trained models transfer learning ability essentially large companies pre train intelligence almost like creating whole bunch new college grads super well educated college grads going world people adapt particular skills lot ways lukas work work weve done weve actually lowered bar weve democratized intelligence democratized computer science almost anybody download pre trained model perform superhuman capabilities application domain retraining adapting applying transfer learning capability think artificial intelligence powerful force come along one benefits going democratize computer science one things mentioned earlier energyi think one greatest projects working thing called earth 2 digital tool whichwere going try build digital twin mimic climate earth multi physics problem thermal dynamics fluid dynamics chemistry problem biology problem human driver problem economic problem contributes geometry awarebecause know terrain matters multi physicsand finally might necessary algorithms able take swing build full scale digital twin earth hopefully inspire us giving us model test mitigation strategies adaptation strategies simulate whether technologies going use absorb carbon carbon emissions necessary impact decade two decades four decades deep learning work wouldnt even possible wouldnt even imagine lukas cool one things wanted make sure asked personal level ive really admired youve run company really long time doesnt look like easy company run mean theres lot going lot physical things clearly hasnt rocket ship saas startup yet seem technically current really seem like stay top trends keep level technical depth wondering stay educated whats going scientific computing machine learning topics jensen well im little sleepy right three oclock reading andtheres way think keep learning lukas youre interested topic jensen dont know dont know theresi wish lukas wisdom pass paused second secret nope think partly course really wheres energy curiosity juice coming surrounded really bright people learn allows combine lot understanding decode puzzle learn something new really gets fired think one important missions purpose ceo create conditions amazing people could lifes work really take seriously try hard create condition amazing people could come surrounded colleagues incredible think contributes lot rest itas ceo tech company really need enjoy learning whats happening company plenty learn whats happening around industry see could imagine future thats better everybody lukas think big part learning process thats hard running company tinkering stuff im wondering thatsi think youre originally engineer find time ever write little code put something together jensen long time get tinker people wonderful thing nvidia 24000 people could tinker little something everybody amount tinkering thats going around company incredible theres phrase say reach friends really see way reach friends company brainstorm little something go try something somebody else theyre brainstorming try something thats guess tinkering scale lukas thats super cool love another question lot people askim curious people originally think nvidia games gamer play video games jensen havent played much games see almost every game goes get benefit collaboration every game company world theyre labs people tell ill run go check play bit last time probablyone favorite games battlefield first came kids teenagers home coming gaming age three us playing online battlefield incredibly fun probably funnest memories ive ever lukas thats awesome im curious lot people talking know supply chain issues global chip shortage something thats mind lot problem company jensen sure yeah sure build largest chips world complex computers world dgx hundred pounds heavy heaviest computer thats built today heavy takes robot build like car computers dont built way dgx miracle computing built completely blank sheet paper wrote software tools went top theres lot components inside especiallysomething thats thousand watts quite miracle lot parts takes one diode one voltage regulator keep shipping nvidia supply chain quite amazing machine know artificial intelligence amazing thing producing intelligence first time human history producing manufacturing intelligence like production raw material comes lot genius goes box comes intelligence thats refined large companies depending us ai intelligence manufactured large scales teams working really really hard keep demand lukas youve running nvidia quite long time curious feel youve changed leader decades running company jensen know youre almost asking wrong person could ask almost anybody else around lukas fair enough experience changed jensen thats easier question 30 years old didnt know anything ceo lot learning job many management techniques really dumb dont use anymore lukas like jensen well alright ill give couple lukas awesome thank jensen list dumb things ive done years quite large could write book example really wanted early days chips tape thought needed motivate engineers tape chip thing called tapeout bonus thats supremely dumb idea reason engineers could taped chip would putting bonus unnecessary hand definition theyre gon na late theyre late becomes de motivator longer earn bonus tapeout bonus ceos de motivator motivator little silly think answer chip gets taped chip ready taped create conditions great work done good listeners eliminate obstacles team could part solution highlighting issues recruiting kinds things help reason priorities help reduce scope work try seek minimum viable product instead building giant things lot different skills couldve instilled organization one thing doesnt really need tapeout bonus achievement bonus everybodys trying best thats one example lukas thats great one else youve got others id love hear jensen okay heres another one well want diplomatic well theres many ceos could using techniques hate critical criticism style tend one ones theres anything need say tend like say team group working hearing things im hearing things everybody else hearing things instead translated lukas interesting thats really unusual perspective think lot people think absolutely must one ones across company think like reports jensen dont dont many leaders dont criticize dont reason probably important ceos becauseyou cant eliminate completely want reduce amount jensen told jensen told way somehow steer conversation otherwise done merits instead somehow translated repeated interpreted chain particular objection towards something would say one person believe working rest company particular strategy direction ought taken would tell everybody time ive worked towards approach feel much transparent puts knowledge access information hands many people possible course attracts criticism example might say something ten people dumbest thing world say terrible idea know couldnt worse possible strategy instead saying one person dont get benefit refining ideas broadcasting always genius therefore technique need little bit vulnerable need able deal fact every often said something wasnt perfect nobody holds standard needs perfect anyhow nearly 30 years ive kind worked way past say something dumb dont hold give chance change mind lukas different experience running company feels like struggling versus stock seems really high probably everyones feeling really good prospects different things different situations jensen im never different dont think possible find correlation behavior stock price would say 29 years behavior way approach problems way approach people way approach company workexactly theres correlation whatsoever got give second ill find kinds issues talk ive got nothing problems thatyou know ceos surrounded problems good news happen enjoy enjoy solving problems completely separate financial success company importance work impactful work ive historically always done whether company well badly badly particularly time bet farm accelerated computing wanted every single chip architecture mentioned earlier pressure financial performance immense equally enthusiastic believed much future today lukas thats incredible dont feel outside pressure able separate jensen public company youre going feel lot outside pressure investors really artful expressing displeasure criticism investors understandably less patient job express reason ceos bewe reasoned purpose something clear expressing something vision genuinely believe genuinely believe experience people willing give shot first started company consumer 3d graphics didnt exist even apis didnt exist go evangelize took longer people thought moved accelerated computing 15 years didnt exist took longer thought thought going take 2 years took 15 ai way spoke endlessly importance machine learning deep learning first 5 6 7 years think people didnt get fine thats part building new market building new approach recognize takes time people come along think industry really patient us employees patient ive really appreciated lukas whats thing really motivates right whats purpose feel like youre serving moment jensen missionthe company doesnt mission statement nobodys confused company mission really simple impactful work takes long time succeed hard meaningful people best world solving seek problems seek problems two areas im super excited right one area recognizing several domains invented intelligence capability technology intelligence whether perception speech ai language understanding able technologies things however ultimately whats valuable intelligence ultimately whats valuable skills hire new college grads lots intelligence skills give skills adapting domains lot ways thats essentiallywhat missing right take intelligence technology translate valuable skills valuable skills whether driving autonomous vehicles valuable skills like customer service call centers valuable skills like automated checkout could automated skills like radiology put radiologist right instrument kinds really valuable skills create thats big part energy right take enabling technology translate skills customers industry developers could adapt kinds different domains thats one large scale application artificial intelligence second next era ai weve done really good job soft ai thats cloud recommending music recommending movies next item cart forth really incredible thing would really like toif want take ai point people next phase journey ai learn laws physics many worlds challenges whether climate science autonomous vehicles manufacturing whatever ai cant make prediction make prediction obeys laws physics conservation matter conservation energy understand concept synchronous time working within time lot types problems really impossible develop ai unless something essentially virtual world obeys laws physics reason built omniverse built omniverse several things could happen physically based distributed large ability support large models goal several fold one could teach robot well functioning robot physically based environment could connect iot systems example running robot hardware loop ability connected physical world stay synchronized meaning build digital twin concept digital twin around time combination artificial intelligence digital twin going profound impact future im super excited areas one application others next phase ai thats omniverse lukas yeah totally agree things like omniverse really critical making robotics work sounds like youre interested getting company closer applications ai right jensen well stay couple clicks away actual application would would create application framework people building applications build applications one application frameworks im really excited created little demo called toy jensen last gtc keynote basically robot virtual robot otherwise known avatar computer vision speech ai understands language forth im super excited future many applicationswe really need go application experience whether virtual factory virtual hospital could entertainment like metaverse next era internet want go world way go world wormhole called vr go world could also agents come world collaborate us would come wormhole called ar world otherwise metaverse enjoyed using favorite display computer display people think need wear head mounted displays metaverse furthest truth metaverse enjoyed largely 2d displays lukas interesting well always end two questions want make sure get second last question youve touched topics im curious look machine learning feel like theres question thats underexplored like would recommend grad student look time youd like spend time investigating jensen well research work thats done right theres many smart people working really important self supervised learning approaches multi modalitylukas thats going drive living daylights platform youre building platforms building multimodality ai vision vision doesnt images could video speech natural language thats going take perception brand new level im super excited im excited zero shot learning able learn whatever youre trained plus priors really quite exciting powerful think one areas explored project framework graphs framework deep learning graph neural networks graph neural networksgraphs relationship things basically structure describe almost everything meaningful life thats useful lukas totally jensen processing graphs cumbersome breakthroughs dgl gnn geometric project graph framework constructs deep learning pipeline puts world deep learning effective im excited hope lot people work lastly think innovation design creativity thats going done virtual world creativity design ever done physical world people call metaverse going brand new ground manufacturing design artists entertainment kinds im super excited mean theres many things work lukas awesome great answer final question last minutes havetheres trope machine learning especially deep learning projects almost never see light day theyre way harder manage traditional engineering im curious look across customer base common issues prevent machine learning really solving problems customers actually jensen yeah really great great question also one things love company way think theres fundamental difference technology deep learning harnessing deep learning machine learning write software importance methods process tools vital could described mlops vital understand neural network architecture able invent something produces excellent results course groundbreaking work already company order take advantage realize final analysis intelligence factory think like factory thats reason word ops makes sense factory raw material coming data gets transformed middle lot stages complicated transformation one reasons tools popular really complicated stuff manage workflow productive way transform raw material ultimately output neural network otherwise intelligence scale quite significant process fundamentally new way thinking computer science used engineers dont mean way engineers engineers backed giant supercomputers operating incredible operations software stack build refining process continuous refining process validation process simulation processthat entire process reinvented machine learning reinvented deep learning reason work important guys great job really appreciate work researchers support workflows making possible every company needs understand software development future bit refinery process refinement process mlops process know manufacturing lukas well thanks much thats really kind im touched appreciate jensen keep great work lukas youre enjoying interviews want learn please click link show notes description find links papers mentioned supplemental material transcription work really hard produce check
